shapeless is a type class and dependent type based generic programming
library for Scala. It had its origins in several talks by Miles Sabin
(@milessabin), given over the course of 2011, on implementing scrap
your boilerplate and higher rank polymorphism in Scala. With its 2.0
release it has evolved from being a resolutely experimental project
into a library which, while still testing the limits of what's
possible in Scala, is being used widely in production systems wherever
there are arities to be abstracted over and boilerplate to be
scrapped. In this talk I will demonstrate some of the many new
capabilities that shapeless 2.0 brings to the Scala toolbox.
