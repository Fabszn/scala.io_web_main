Big Data is all the rage these days, but people who talk about it  often forget to mention how not trivial it is, to extract value from all the stockpile of data at our disposal. Good tools are central to the success of data crunching at all scale. Scala being both functional and object oriented, with a powerful standard collection library , is one of the tools gaining popularity to dive into Big Data analytics.
With tools like Scalding, Scrunch, Scoobi, Spark, Spark Streaming, GraphX or Saddle, the Scalan ecosystem around Big Data is experiencing some interesting developments. 
In this talk, we aim at browsing a quick portrait of available tools to work with in the Scala ecosystem, and see how your projects can leverage them.
