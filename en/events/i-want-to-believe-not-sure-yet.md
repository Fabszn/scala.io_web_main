In Eligotech we have embraced the functional paradigm through a professional usage of Scala since almost 2 years now.
    
Among others we had to work on the implementation of a white label application now in production (Play!, Akka, Scala 2.10.x). This application works nicely but some conceptual mistakes were introduced since the begining as as a too strong influence from oop background. Fortunately the edition of the book ""functional programming in scala"" brought to the community a real enligthnement on how some concepts could or should be developped.
The periodic addition of new modules to that application opened opportunities to follow the guidelines from the book, improving the readeability, maintenance and quality of the code.

The presentation aims to show some example as short pieces of code of what we got wrong, extracts of recently coded modules following the reasoning from the book and incoming improvements showing the progress before and after we refactor existing piece of code (database persistence). Code samples should  contain simple trait definitions with very few line of code implementation when necessary.

Conclusion is to invite more people to read that book and even more people to share what they learn on a daily base.
