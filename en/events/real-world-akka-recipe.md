In the brave new world of actor programming, conventional design patterns frequently are not applicable. Co-produced with Akka engineering team members Bj√∂rn Antonsson and Patrik Nordwall, this talk will describe three new patterns using Akka actors, including how to handle a lack of guaranteed delivery, ways to distribute tasks to worker actors in the face of heavy load and how to implement distributed workers in an Akka cluster.
