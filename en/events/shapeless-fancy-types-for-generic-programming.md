An extended workshop on the concepts and techniques employed in shapeless.

The workshop will start with a walkthrough of various parts of the
library, followed by dojo style challenges using, extending or
borrowing ideas from shapeless to solve problems chosen by the
participants. With any luck we might be able to generate a few useful
pull requests against the project by the end of the session.

If you're already using shapeless and have topics you'd like to work
through then bring them with you. And if you're interested in finding
out what all the fuss is about and what can be done with shapeless
then this is the perfect event for you.
