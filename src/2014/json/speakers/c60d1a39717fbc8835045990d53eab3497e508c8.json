Both threats force us to spread out the application, to distribute it. This presentation takes a deep dive into reactive application architecture, focusing on how to build reliable communication upon normal best-effort messaging—with examples using Akka. Knowing the trade-offs allows us to build systems that strike the right balance between partition tolerance, consistency, availability, implementation complexity and operational cost.</p>\n","links":[{"href":"http://cfp.scala.io/api/conferences/scalaIOFR2014/talks/IZB-863","rel":"http://cfp.scala.io/api/profile/talk","title":"More details about this talk"},{"href":"http://cfp.scala.io/api/conferences/scalaIOFR2014/speakers/c60d1a39717fbc8835045990d53eab3497e508c8","rel":"http://cfp.scala.io/api/profile/speaker","title":"Roland Kuhn"}],"id":"IZB-863","title":"Distributed in Space and Time","talkLang":"en"}],"company":"Typesafe Inc.","bio":"Roland Kuhn is leading the Akka project at Typesafe, a co-author of the Reactive Manifesto and the book Reactive Design Patterns, co-teaching the Coursera course “Principles of Reactive Programming” and a passionate open-source hakker.
