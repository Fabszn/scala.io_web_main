This talk is the report of a battle. A battle against common sense. A battle of
one man against one world. A world with no objects and no for-loops to cling to.
You've been struggling against Scala? Well, how cute is that.
The beast I'm telling you about is of a whole other kind. It's a beast that's
beyond the most twisted nightmares of H.P. Lovecraft himself.
'Cause we're goin' in for the big game.
Lost in the mazes of lazily evaluated thunks, strictness invariants and monads
will be our sole guides.
And y'ain't wanna mess with that kind o' guide, 'tis what I'm telling you, or
they're gonna blow the heap out of ya.
This ain't no ride for wimps, but if we get out of this alive, you will have
learnt the meaning of life, or in other words:

- how to tame lazy evaluation by default,
- how to process collections of data with nothing but regular functions,
- why Algebraic Abstractions From Hell matter,
- how to implement your own execution control method,
- and maybe how to do things concurrently and in parallel (i.e how to do stuff
  faster and then screw up stuff faster).
