 We'll start with a high-level introduction and overview of [spray](http://spray.io), its motivation, philosophy, structure and key features. Then we'll take a closer look at the components making up the server-side part of the HTTP stack that spray implements: akka-io, spray-can and spray-routing. This talk will provide a good foundation for the spray workshop later, but will also be interesting for everyone who is not planning on participating in the workshop.
