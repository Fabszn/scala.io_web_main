Do you still think of types as Int, String and Object? Types like &quot;Fold[Nat, ({ type L[X &lt;: HList, Z &lt;: Nat] = Succ[Z] })#L, Nat._0]&quot; are only a small step away. You can have the compiler perform computations on natural numbers, enforce the sizes of collections and always get the correct element type out of a heterogeneous list. All of that happens at compile-time without impacting the runtime performance of your code.</p>\n","links":[{"href":"http://cfp.scala.io/api/conferences/scalaIOFR2014/talks/CUP-414","rel":"http://cfp.scala.io/api/profile/talk","title":"More details about this talk"},{"href":"http://cfp.scala.io/api/conferences/scalaIOFR2014/speakers/4efd627cb19fe4cacde8b01751b0475ea797214c","rel":"http://cfp.scala.io/api/profile/speaker","title":"Stefan Zeiger"}],"id":"CUP-414","title":"Type-Level Computations in Scala","talkLang":"en"}],"company":"Typesafe","bio":"Stefan Zeiger is the tech lead for Slick.
