In this workshop you'll be building a small example application (a simple web-based multi-user chat client) with spray from the ground up. We'll guide you through all stages of an actual project: setup, architecture and API design, implementation as well as a few iterations of optimization and polishing. Bring your laptop as you'll be coding for most of this session. Of course there'll be plenty of opportunity for asking questions, discussions, etc.
The goal of this session is to give you a hands-on impression of how easy it is to build a web API with spray and to equip you with all the basic knowledge required to start your own project.
