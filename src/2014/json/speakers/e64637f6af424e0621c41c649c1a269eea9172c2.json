The talk will cover how the whole system works from the user-perspective, its high level architecture and some implementation details, as well as which Scala features were very useful, and which turned out to be problematic and why.</p>\n","links":[{"href":"http://cfp.scala.io/api/conferences/scalaIOFR2014/talks/XEK-617","rel":"http://cfp.scala.io/api/profile/talk","title":"More details about this talk"},{"href":"http://cfp.scala.io/api/conferences/scalaIOFR2014/speakers/e64637f6af424e0621c41c649c1a269eea9172c2","rel":"http://cfp.scala.io/api/profile/speaker","title":"Piotr Kołaczkowski"}],"id":"XEK-617","title":"Lightning fast cluster computing with Cassandra and Spark","talkLang":"en"}],"company":"DataStax","bio":"Piotr Kołaczkowski is a lead software engineer at DataStax, where he develops analytic components of DataStax Enterprise platform built on top of Apache Cassandra.
