The nature of development is shifting from good old, database centric applications, to distributed, fault-tolerant and highly connected architectures, consuming data from heterogeneous data-sources. We demand new libraries and tooling to validate and transform those nasty untrusted blobs, and map them to our beloved typesafe data structures.

This talk gives insights on solving those tricky issues using Scala and functional programming.
We will also give an overview of Play 2.3 validation API, which generalizes Play 2.1 Json validation.
