Pure functional programming allows us to write clean and modular code. But to
write real programs, we have to interact with the outside world through I/O.
Does this mean that we must resort to side-effects and abandon functional
techniques? In this talk, we will see that the answer is exactly the contrary;
side-effects make I/O harder, not easier.

We will discuss how to approach I/O from a purely functional perspective,
explore the space of existing solutions, their benefits, and drawbacks
