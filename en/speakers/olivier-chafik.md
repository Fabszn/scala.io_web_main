Working in London at Google on anything but Scala (not that he hasn't tried), Olivier has worked on financial software and 3D graphics before but only gets really high on his open-source projects: JNAerator, BridJ and JavaCL. Scala has now become his experimental language of choice, with Scalaxy and ScalaCL as playground projects.
