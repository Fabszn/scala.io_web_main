You have probably heard Jonas Bon√©r talk about Akka. Words like "scalable" and "reactive" are buzzing around the industry. There clearly is a growing need for scalable, reactive, event-driven applications but there is not all that much practical information out there about how to build serious applications this way. How would you go about designing an application around these new(ish) concepts? What does it mean for an application to be reactive? What works and what doesn't?

In this talk we will show you what we have learned from multiple years of designing serious, real-world applications with Akka. We will show you which application and domain concepts should be modeled as actors, when and how to use Futures, how to prevent bottlenecks when calling blocking code, what Akka extensions are for, how to expose a REST API on top of Akka with Spray, and how to test all of the above.

In short: we will assume you have heard the What and the Why so we will concentrate on the How
