Learn how to build an external DSL (Domain Specific Languages). When used judiciously a DSL offers advantages like expressivity, higher level of abstraction, simplified development.
In this talk, we'll look at implementing a mini language. By way of code examples, we'll show how to incrementally build a Lisp dialect on top of Scala:

* Parsing code with combinator parsers
* Defining datatypes and functions
* Evaluating expressions
* Implementing Higher order functions

By the end of the talk, you'll know to use (and abuse) DSLs.
