This session is an practical introduction to functional web programming with clojure. It exposes from the ground up all the major ingredients it takes to design, build and run an application that scraps a website to generate a summary of billed train tickets. The session will cover such aspects as: Developing with emacs and leiningen, deploying application with git, scraping and generating pages with clojure, testing with midje, documenting with marginalia.
