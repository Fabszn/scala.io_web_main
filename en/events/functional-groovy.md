Yes, Groovy is functional too!

Groovy closures are our fist-class citizen functions, that you can recurse, compose, memoize, trampoline and curry, and that you can leverage to build higher order functions and Domain-Specific Languages.

With them, the usual map / filter / reduce logic can be applied elegantly to your problem domain.

We will also not forget to speak about immutability, tail recursion, laziness, infinite streams.

Will also be mentioned useful libraries that marry elegantly with Groovy, for giving you more bang for the buck, to deal with concurrency and parallelism, or even persistent collections.
