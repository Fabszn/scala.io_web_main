Rediscala is one of the fastest Redis client libraries. The talk will revealed the secret recipe between Akka, Akka IO and Scala to get a really fast redis client. Of course the results of the benchmarks with scalameter will be there to support the claims.
Futhermore, a nice API is also important, so a tour of the friendly API will be done (Transaction, Scripting, Pub/Sub, ...).
