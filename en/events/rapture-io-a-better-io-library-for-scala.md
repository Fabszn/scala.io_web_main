Jon will be talking about Rapture I/O , a comprehensive open-source Scala library providing much of the functionality of the java.io and java.net packages with a much more intuitive and extensible Scala API. 
Rapture I/O takes advantage of Scala's best features to provide a simple and safe interface to common I/O operations.

A particular focus will be Rapture I/O's support for JSON handling, which makes working with dynamically-typed JSON a more natural experience in the statically-typed Scala world. Jon will also introduce a novel Scala pattern which boldly aims to unify the various (and sometimes divisive) approaches to handling exceptions!
