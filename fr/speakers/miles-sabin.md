Miles does stuff with Scala for Precog. When not working on Precog, he does his utmost to break Scalaâ€™s typechecker with his project shapeless and is a regular speaker at Scala and functional programming events. He can often be found walking in the South Downs around his home in Brighton with a camera and an unfeasibly energetic English Springer Spaniel named Tigger.
