Reactive Design enables to build very scalable web applications. However, in most cases consuming and storing data in a database are still blocking operations, and written in imperative style.

With the appropriate drivers and libraries, it is possible to interact with databases reactively, using a functional approach. This talk gives an overview of ReactiveMongo, which is a reactive, non-blocking Scala driver for MongoDB. It shows how data can be read or written in a streaming fashion, and how it helps making fully non-blocking web applications from the client to the database.
