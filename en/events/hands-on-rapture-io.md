The first half of the workshop will explore Rapture I/O's capabilities in more depth, showing how they are used in practice, and how they can help you write cleaner, more readable, more maintainable I/O code.

Following on from this, Jon will explore how some of Scala's more advanced features have led to innovative solutions in the design of Rapture I/O's API. Even for developers without any I/O requirements, this is a great opportunity to learn more about good principles of API design, and how they can be put into practice in your own projects and libraries. Themes covered will include implicits, type classes, the Cake Pattern, macros, and more!
