I am a developer at Gilt where I'm leading the project to completely change how hardware and software is provisioned and deployed to a Scala-inspired immutable model. I'm a contributor to Gatling, a great open-source load testing tool built on Scala and Akka that I introduced to Gilt and we now use as the foundation of our load testing platform.

I've been programming almost as long as I can remember; before joining Gilt I founded a couple of startups and spent some time working for Amazon.
