Scalaz is an extension to the Scala standard library providing purely
functional data structures and useful abstractions. Shapeless is a library
for generic programming and pushes Scala's type system quite far.
Recently, there have been some developments in providing interoperability
between both libraries, which turns out to be massively useful.

In this talk, I will showcase some of the cool available techniques,
including abstracting over heterogeneous data and the arity of functions,
using macros to generate type class instances, and (de)serializing data
with zero boilerplate.
